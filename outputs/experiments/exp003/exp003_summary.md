# exp003 Summary

## 1. Experiment Overview
This experiment is best interpreted as an additional baseline-style replay versus no-replay comparison using the original task order. It compares the saved runs over the task sequence `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.

## 2. Research Question
Does replay improve retention and final performance when the model is trained sequentially on `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`?

## 3. Experiment Design
- Replay run: `exp003_replay_3tasks` with replay enabled on the task sequence `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.
- No-replay run: `exp003_no_replay_3tasks` with replay disabled on the same task sequence.
- Task sequence: `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.
- Comparison target: final validation accuracy, final test accuracy, and saved forgetting values.
- Why this comparison is useful: it isolates the effect of replay while keeping the task order and general training setup aligned across conditions.

## 4. Task and Dataset Description
- `sciq`: science question answering task.
- `arc_challenge`: challenging grade-school science question answering task.
- `boolq`: yes/no question answering task.
- Together, these tasks act as a lightweight continual learning sequence rather than a large-scale benchmark sweep.

## 5. Run Commands
- Replay run command (reconstructed from saved `run_config.json` because the exact invocation string was not persisted): `python main.py --run-name exp003_replay_3tasks --tasks sciq arc_challenge boolq`
- No-replay run command (reconstructed from saved `run_config.json` because the exact invocation string was not persisted): `python main.py --run-name exp003_no_replay_3tasks --tasks sciq arc_challenge boolq --no-replay`

## 8. Output Files and Their Purpose
- `checkpoints/`: saved model and tokenizer checkpoints after each task, useful for inspecting intermediate training states.
- `logs/`: console output plus training summary CSVs, useful for checking whether runs completed and how many training steps were recorded.
- `metrics/`: validation and test metric CSVs plus prediction files, which are the main source for the comparisons in this report.
- `replay_scores/`: per-sample replay scoring CSVs used only when replay is enabled; for no-replay runs this folder may be empty.
- `replay_buffers/`: replay buffer snapshots and the replay buffer summary CSV; for no-replay runs these files can be empty placeholders.
- `run_config.json`: the saved resolved configuration for each run folder, including task order and output paths.
- `exp003_summary.md`: this experiment-level report generated from the saved files in both run folders.

## 9. Metric Definitions
- Validation accuracy: the fraction of validation examples answered correctly for a task after training has reached the final saved task state.
- Test accuracy: the fraction of held-out test examples answered correctly for a task after the final saved task state.
- Forgetting: a conceptual measure of how much a task's performance drops after learning later tasks compared with its best earlier saved performance. The code saves this value directly, so this report explains it conceptually rather than inventing a new formula.
- Delta between replay and no-replay: `Replay score - No Replay score`. A positive delta means replay performed better, while a negative delta means the no-replay run performed better.

## 10. Final Validation Accuracy Comparison
| Task | Replay | No Replay | Delta | Better Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sciq | 0.3000 | 0.3000 | 0.0000 | Tie |
| arc_challenge | 0.2000 | 0.2333 | -0.0333 | No Replay |
| boolq | 0.5333 | 0.5333 | 0.0000 | Tie |

## 11. Final Test Accuracy Comparison
| Task | Replay | No Replay | Delta | Better Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sciq | 0.3200 | 0.5000 | -0.1800 | No Replay |
| arc_challenge | 0.2800 | 0.2200 | 0.0600 | Replay |
| boolq | 0.5000 | 0.4600 | 0.0400 | Replay |

## 12. Forgetting Analysis
| Task | Replay Forgetting | No Replay Forgetting | Lower Forgetting Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sciq | 0.1000 | 0.1000 | Tie |
| arc_challenge | 0.0333 | 0.0667 | Replay |
| boolq | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | Tie |
- Some forgetting was observed in the saved final validation metrics after later tasks were learned.
- The maximum saved forgetting was identical in both settings at 0.1000.

## 13. Replay Artifacts Analysis
- Replay run `exp003_replay_3tasks` saved 3 replay score CSV file(s).
- Replay run `exp003_replay_3tasks` saved 3 replay buffer snapshot file(s).
- 3 of those replay buffer snapshot file(s) are non-empty, which suggests replay was actively selecting and storing samples.
- No-replay run `exp003_no_replay_3tasks` has replay disabled by configuration.
- Its `replay_scores/` folder contains 0 replay score CSV file(s), which is expected to be zero when replay is disabled.
- Its `replay_buffers/` folder contains 3 replay buffer snapshot file(s), with 0 non-empty snapshot(s); empty files indicate placeholders rather than active replay.

## 14. Main Findings
- The saved comparison covers the task sequence `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.
- The average replay-minus-no-replay final validation accuracy delta was -0.0111.
- The average replay-minus-no-replay final test accuracy delta was -0.0267.
- Some forgetting was observed in the saved final validation metrics after later tasks were learned.
- Replay artifacts were actually produced for the replay run (3 score file(s), 3 non-empty buffer snapshot(s)), so replay appears to have been active.

## 15. Interpretation
- Replay reduced final validation accuracy on average by 0.0111 across the saved tasks.
- Replay reduced final test accuracy on average by 0.0267 across the saved tasks.
- The maximum saved forgetting was identical in both settings at 0.1000.
- Overall, the saved comparison provides mixed evidence rather than a consistent case that replay is beneficial under this setting.
- Mixed results are plausible here because the setup uses one seed, one epoch, lightweight sample sizes, and a fixed replay configuration rather than a tuned sweep.

## 16. Limitations
- Single random seed: `42`.
- One-epoch training: `1` epoch(s) were saved in the configuration.
- Lightweight subset sizes: train=100, val=30, test=50.
- Limited task count in this experiment: `3` task(s).
- Only one replay configuration is represented in the saved files, so replay hyperparameters were not broadly explored here.
- These results come from a lightweight saved setting and may not generalize without more seeds, task orders, or larger sample sizes.

## 17. Relation to Other Experiments
- `exp001` uses a `3`-task saved sequence: `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.
- `exp002` uses a `3`-task saved sequence: `boolq -> arc_challenge -> sciq`.
- `exp003` uses a `3`-task saved sequence: `sciq -> arc_challenge -> boolq`.

## 18. Next Step
Test replay buffer size or replay sampling strategy to examine whether replay can become more consistently useful.
